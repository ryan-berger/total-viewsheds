# Total Viewshed Calculator

Calculates the total visible surface from every point of a given terrain.

## Original Idea
The main algorithm is based on the work of S. Tabik, A. R. Cervilla, E. Zapata and L. F. Romero from
*Arquitectura De Los Computadores at The University Of Malaga* in their paper: "Efficient Data Structure and Highly Scalable Algorithm for Total-Viewshed Computation".
