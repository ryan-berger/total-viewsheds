NB: This project is currently very much work in progress. My aim is to fully document it and make it as easy to use and contribute to as possible.

# Total Viewshed Calculator
Calculates the total visible surface from every point of a given terrain. For example, the viewshed for the summit of a mountain will be large and for a valley it will be small. There are other viewshed calculators, most notably for [Arcgis](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/3d-analyst/viewshed.htm<Paste>), but they only calculate single viewsheds for a specific point. The algorithm used here however takes advantage of the computational efficiency gained by calculating *all*, therefore the total, viewsheds for a given region.

This is an example of a single viewshed from the summit of Mt. Diablo in California. It was created by another viewshed tool called [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com).

## Algorithm
This project is based on the work of S. Tabik, A. R. Cervilla, E. Zapata and L.F. Romero from the University of MÃ¡laga, in their paper; [Efficient Data Structure and Highly Scalable Algorithm for Total-Viewshed Computation](www.ac.uma.es/~siham/STARS.pdf).

## Code style
Styling follows [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
It can be automated with [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) (included when installing clang). This repo contains a `.clang-format` file defining the rules for Google's style guide (generated with `clang-format -style=google -dump-config > .clang-format`).
